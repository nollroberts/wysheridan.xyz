The Purpose of this site is two-fold.

First is to promote and aide civil paritication by the greatest number of 
county residences. 
Chiefly this will be accomplished by helping precincts to determine and make public statements of their current policy priorities.

Second is to provide tools for the citizenry to engage in its civic duties with its elected representatives.

## Audience & Goal
The intended audience is the Sheridan County Wyoming Citizenry.

The goal is to assist citizens in meaningful public communication.

## Precincts
By breaking down the County population into Precincts, it should be
easier to have meaningful discussion.

If needed the precincts can further be broken up into smaller subsets.

## Develoment 
- Citizens of any Sheridan County Precinct are invited to participate. 
- Decision and concensus building will be measured by vote, one person one vote, with the results being reported publicly back to the citizenry.   
- How topics and information will be added to each precincts webpage(s) will be decided by the participating citizens of each precinct.
- Email and GitHub are two options for Internet communication and collaboration of ideas.
- Initally this site will be one option for reporting to the citizenry of each precinct and the county as a whole.
